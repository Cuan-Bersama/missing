missing.css is the missing CSS library that we all wished existed:

  * It starts with decent default styling for vanilla HTML, akin to classless CSS libraries
  * It offers a small set of components based on purely standard, semantic HTML, utilizing ARIA where appropriate, such as tabs.
  * Finally, it offers a small & curated set of class-based utilities for tweaking the styling of a site

The objective of missing.css is to minimize the neccessary intervention in the HTML by allowing developers to
start with a good out of the box experience, then build common components using plain, semantic HTML and
then, only if necessary, apply a minimal number of classes to achieve.

**Did you know?** The `<main>` element can only have these elements as ancestors:
`<html>`, `<body>`, `<div>`, `<form>` without an accessible name, and autonomous custom elements.

missing.css is not designed to be a complete styling solution for large websites.  It may serve as a basis
for a more completely styled site, but does not attempt to offer the completeness of, say, bootstrap.

It is, however, explicitly designed to be complete enough to use for small sites, internal tools or
personal projects.
