            missing.css is the missing CSS lirary that we all wished existed:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                It starts with decent default styling for vanilla HTML, akin to classless CSS libraries
            </li>
            <li>
                It offers a small set of components based on purely standard, semantic HTML, utilizing ARIA where
                appropriate,
                such as tabs.
            </li>
            <li>
                * Finally, it offers a small & curated set of class-based utilities for tweaking the styling of a site
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The objective of missing.css is to minimize the neccessary intervention in the HTML by allowing developers
            to
            start with a good out of the box experience, then build common components using plain, semantic HTML and
            then, only if necessary, apply a minimal number of classes to achieve.
        </p>
        <p>
            missing.css is not designed to be a complete styling solution for large websites. It may serve as a basis
            for a more completely styled site, but does not attempt to offer the completeness of, say, bootstrap.
        </p>
        <p>It is, however, explicitly designed to be complete enough to use for small sites, internal tools or
            personal projects.
